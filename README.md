##### **Abstract:**

A box with some sensors around it to can sense changes in the environment. The little creature inside this box reacts differently depending on the readings of those sensors.

##### **Components:**

+ LDR's
+ Acellerometer
+ Piezo Buzzer
+ Thermistor
+ Maybe some more?

##### **The Game:**

*Creature House* will have players interacting with a physical box where inside lives a small, cute creature. Being so small, the creature is very sensitive to changes in it's environment and picking up, moving or otherwise playing around with the creatures house will cause them to respond appropriately. The creature's house will have **multiple sensors to detect changes in light, position, orientation, ambient sound and temperature** around it. Using the **Unity Engine** I plan to make the creature responsive to the changes around it's house and provide feedback both didgitally and through sound. I want to make the creature quite "chatty" using a **passive buzzer** to make sounds as feedback for the player.
